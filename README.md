# GAN for Image Style Transfer of Paintings by Claude Monet
Build and train generative adversarial networks using the paintings of Claude Monet.

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) consist of two or more neural networks, a generator network that creates images and a discriminator network to train the generator. The discriminator classifies the images as real or fake. These are called adversarial networks because they are competing. The generator is working to maximize the chances that a mistake is made by the discriminator, and the discriminator is trying to minimize the chances of making a mistake. The task is to generate 7,000 to 10,000 images that are in the style of Monet’s paintings and fool the discriminator. The data used for this work is available at Kaggle as part of the competition, I’m Something of a Painter Myself.
